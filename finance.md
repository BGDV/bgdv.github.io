## Privacy Policy [here](finance_privacy)

## How it works
1. «Finance: personal assistant» - a program designed to maintain and record personal finances.
2. The program runs locally. Doesn't work with network. Therefore, no data is collected or sent over the network. All information is stored only on the device.
3. The application supports multi-user mode.
4. After creating the user, you are prompted to create the required accounting profile. If desired, the profile can be hidden from the list of created profiles.
5. The main screen consists of the tabs "Income", "Expenses", "Statistics", "Settings".
6. In each of the Income and Expenses sections, the user creates categories into which the amounts of income or expenses are entered.
7. Categories can be swapped, deleted or renamed. If amounts have already been entered into the category, when deleting, the program will offer to transfer these amounts to another category or not save them.
8. The interface has a "monthly" division with convenient fast scrolling of months forward or backward.
9. The Statistics section displays the total amount of funds received for the period, funds spent for the period, and what is the difference. You can also open the "By categories" list to view the statistics of the amounts in the selected period for each category separately.
10. The graph visually shows the dynamics of income and expenses in the selected period as red and blue lines.
11. The program allows you to search for the notes to the amounts. This can be useful for keeping track of certain expenses or receipts.
12. In the settings, you can enable or disable the display of the date of payment of the amount and notes opposite the amounts.
13. You can enable a password to enter the application.
14. Also in the settings you can change the profile, log out of the account, delete the profile or erase all data.
